An implementation of Hierarchical State Machine in ActionScript3.0 for AI bot/agent in a video games

HSM is a FSM too, but unlike the traditional FSM, it can handle the states in hierarchy. You can define detailed states in a state and group states which have same target state.
So it is better implementation of state machine if the agent have complex and a lot of states.

The implementation is almost similiar with FSM, but in HSM there are two types of state which extends BaseHSMState Class.
1. Composite State: State which have a children
2. Atomic State: State with no children

So instead of implementing IState interface like on FSM one, in HSM both composite and atomic concrete states are extends BaseHSMState class.
